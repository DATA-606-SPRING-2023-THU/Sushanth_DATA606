**1) What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?**

Ans)
'''I am working on the crops and livestock data. The goal is to cover all aspects of primary crop production for all nations and places in the world and get the best outcome from the land available. Added to that we will be also working on population data which will help in complementing the crop data we are working on. This combined data will enable us to have a comprehensive understanding of the area and the people.'''

**2) Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?**

Ans)
'''Food and agriculture organizations comprehend where and why hunger and malnutrition occur, as well as the forms they take and how widespread they are. So that we can stop those famines from occurring in that area. This will be helpful for a lot of NGOs and international organizations in preventing famines and mass malnutrition. '''
 
**3) What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?**

Ans)
=> What is the best kind of crop type to be placed on the land? It can be solved by comparing the lands with numerous attributes.
=> How to increase the crop production of the land. It is done by understanding the various parameters which are increasing yield.
=> Which kinds of crops and livestock are best for decreasing malnutrition?
=> What kind of crop and life stock production will help increase or decrease population?
 
 
**4) Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of 
data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?**

Ans)
We get the data from “The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations”. The data is quite good and semi-cleaned, the size of the data is 465 MB. The features of the data are Area, Country, Crop time, year, Value, and so on. Along with that, we will also be getting population data from "The Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division of the United Nation". The size of this data is 22.4 MB. The features of the data we will be working with are our Location, year, Male and female population, and population Density.
 
**5) What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?**

Ans)
My unit of analysis is the country, at a certain year for both the data combined. We will be working in 195 countries, from the year 1961-2019.
 
**6) What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?**

Ans)
We will be working on what type of crop is being produced, in what year it is been produced, how much quantity is being produced, what is the value of the produced item, what is the population in that year, what is the population density in that year, Male to female ratio at that year and so on.
 
**7) What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?**

Ans)
We will be working on prediction models like Logistic regression, Rigid Regression, and Random Forest Classifier for the prediction of data like how to increase production. I will be using Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, and Logistic Regression Classifier for finding which crop is best for what region. It will be also useful in understanding numerous misconceptions such as an increase in production will result in stabilizing the male and female population, an increase in life stock production will result in less population density and so on. 

**8) How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how do you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?**

Ans)
I will be using various Prediction and classification models mentioned above to get the required results. I will be evaluating and comparing the models using cross-validation on all the models.
 
**9) What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practical applications, etc)?**

Ans)
We will be able to better understand how crop and livestock production can be improved based on a certain region. We can also understand how it is evolving and can predict what will be the outcome of some crops shortly. We will be also able to understand how an increase or decrease in production will result in an increase or decrease in population over the years and what kind of crop or livestock will increase the female population.
